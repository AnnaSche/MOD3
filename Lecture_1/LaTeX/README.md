Slides and material needed to the introduction to LaTeX

You will find in this folder the short ppt presentation of what is LaTeX and why do we use LaTeX.
You will also find two short practicals. Practical 1 is a brief demonstration of how you can create a basic LaTeX document
while practical 2 shows you how to use a set of different functions. In the process of working your way through practical 2
you will create your own manuscript template that you can later update to your tastes.

Before you start the practical you need to create a directory and save all the documents under it.

I hope you enjoy it.

Dr Juvigny-Khenafou.

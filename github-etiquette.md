Students do not need to read this.

HOW TO USE THIS REPO:<br/>
The repository is free for all the different lecturers to upload the material needed for each lecture.

In order to keep a smooth running of the repository, it is suggested to upload the slide materials after the lecture has been delivered. However, prior to the lectures you all need to make sure that all the materials needed to complete the practicals has been uploaded to the right folders and that you have updated the to-download file.<br/>
In addition, to facilitate the use of the repository for the students it is suggested to use links to the correct files directly in the README files of each folder.

Cheers everyone!

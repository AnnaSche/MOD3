# we start by checking the
# present working directory
pwd

# display files
ls

# also hidden files
ls -a

# format differently
ls -a -la

# same as
ls -al

# we change the pwd

cd  # needs directory on your computer

# How to copy path on windows: https://www.howtogeek.com/670447/how-to-copy-the-full-path-of-a-file-on-windows-10/
# On some OSs you can drag and drop the directory to have the path

# change dir to a level higher
cd..

# make directory for playing around
mkdir test

# set dir
cd test

echo "Hello World"

# now save output to file
echo "Hello World" > output_file.txt

# read from file with command cat
cat output_file.txt

# append to existing file
echo "Hello Moon" >> output_file.txt

# show output
cat output_file.txt

# more meaningful example
echo -e '5\n9\n4\n1\n0\n6\n2' > to_sort

cat to_sort

# use file as input on sort command
sort < to_sort

# store result in file "sorted"
sort < to_sort > sorted

# now copy a file
cp sorted sorted_backup

# copy whole directory
# first cd
cd ..
cp -r test test_backup

# remove (delete) file
rm sorted_backup

# move file
mv output_file.txt ..

ls

# use wildcard and cd directory
cd *_backup

# Brace expansion
# create some directories
mkdir {2015..2020}_{1..3}

# remove all directories with _3
rm -r *_3
# what happens, if you remove -r?

# remove all directories from before 2020 with _2
rm -r 201?_2

# remove remaining directories
rm -r *

# use Shell for calculation
echo $((5*2))

# more complex
echo $(($((5*2)) * 3))

# double multiplication means power
echo $((5**2))

# demonstrate pipe
cd ~/Desktop

# show disk usage of files and directories
du -h
# argument -h makes human readable

# only total
du -sh

# now use pipe and sort output of du
du -h | sort -h

# finally examples for a loop
for i in file1 file2 file3; do echo $i; done

for i in $(seq 0 9); do echo $i; done

# the sequence command is only executed if in quotation marks
for i in seq 0 9; do echo $i; done

# assign variable
VAR1="Hello Venus"

# call value of variable
echo $VAR1

# more meaningful example
SEQVAR="$(seq 0 9)"
echo $SEQVAR #check what happens if you forget the $ sign

# use in loop
for i in $SEQVAR; do echo $i; done
